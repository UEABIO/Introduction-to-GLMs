## Outline (50mins per topic?)

1.   A Very Short Introduction to R and Useful Packages: This session briefly overviews the R programming language and introduces participants to essential R packages for data analysis.
2. (General) Linear Models (LMs): Explore the fundamental concepts and applications of linear regression analysis
3. Generalized Linear Models (GLMs): Building upon linear models, this session extends the framework to accommodate non-normal response variables, introducing concepts like link functions and exponential families.

8.   GLMs for Binomial Data: Focus on applying GLMs to binomial data, covering logistic regression and addressing issues related to modelling binary response variables.
9.   GLMs for Binary Data: This session addresses GLMs for binary data, providing insights into logistic regression and its applications in modelling dichotomous outcomes.


5.   GLMs for Count Data: Delve into applying GLMs for count data, examining the Poisson distribution and addressing modelling challenges specific to count variables.
6.   GLMs for Over-dispersed Count Data: Explore techniques for handling over-dispersion in count data within the GLM framework, emphasizing practical approaches to improve model accuracy.
7.   GLMs for Zero-Inflated Data: Investigate modelling techniques for datasets with excess zeros, understanding how to address the specific challenges posed by zero-inflated count data.


Power Analysis

Survival Analysis?

10. Other Family Distributions: Explore alternative family distributions within the GLM framework, specifically focusing on the Gamma distribution and its applications in modelling continuous, positive-valued responses.

## Data

Binary data: mayflies, bacteria, malaria

Examples: https://www.modernstatisticswithr.com/regression.html#generalised-linear-models

Monarchs in gardens - simple poisson. 

https://www.middleprofessor.com/files/applied-biostatistics_bookdown/_book/generalized-linear-models-i-count-data.html - 
Parasite worked example - use negbin to accurately model

cuckoo - needs zeroinflation! 

Warbler data - predict malaria risk by age and size - Dave R data - Bernoulli model

Beetles - shows weights and cbind. overdispersion? 

Slugs: https://environmentalcomputing.net/statistics/glms/glm-2/ - needs zeroinflation.
